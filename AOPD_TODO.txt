BUGS:
- moving out of the depot into same cell someone else is trying to move (gets you teleported)
- moving into the depot when our own agent is in gives it a chance to be teleported instead of dropping

MISSING STUFF:
- pathfinding around enemy players
- go "idle" if target unreachable 3 times in a row
- check reachability before suggesting closest gold, drop down to next reachable
- exploration
